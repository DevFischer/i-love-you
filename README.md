making long distance a little easier

I made this for my girlfriend. She lives in China, I live in the UK. Also, because!

You can test it out here. Thanks to the Red Hat Openshift free tier, the nodejs part of this app is hosted online!

# installation

    npm install
    port=8123 npm run start

Note the `port` variable. Set this to whatever you like.

Then, at the bottom of `./site/index.html` adjust the port number & remove/modify the Google Analytics snippet.

... Then direct your web server at the `./site` directory and have fun!

In `Gruntfile.js` edit the `s3:{}` task to specify your AWS bucket region & name. You can also hardcode key and secret here but be careful with public repos.

Then, run this in your CLI:

    key=XXXXXX secret=XXXXXX npm run deploy

You can also make a `.env` file and store the variables in there. The file is ignored by git, so you don't have to fear pushing up keys.
